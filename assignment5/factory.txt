There are many different solutions to this problem because there are many different permutations
of the solution, but overall they lead to the same place. 
The order of identical predicates can be interchanged; for example, you can paint 'a' then 'b', or 'b' then 'a'.
The results were not quickly computed (as it took around 14s for the program to finish running).

With the useless predicate heuristic, the program took a fraction of the time to run.
The number of solutions do not change though (which makes sense), since the problem should have the same solutions no matter what.
